# AutomatedScripts
This repository contains all the scripts I have used for ctfs. These scripts are used for a variety of different purposes.
I know that each machine is unique in a way that each has a different way of being hacked into so I cannot build a genral script that 
will automatically hack the particualr machine.

1. pinmap.sh- A general script used to combine the ping and the nmap commands by entering the ip-address of the particular machine in it.

2. pinmapsploit.sh- A general script that combines three commands into a single executable script. These commands are: ping,
   nmap and searchsploit.
